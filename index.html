  Journal 1: Making Homemade Bobba + Bubble Tea
</p>

<p class ="t2">
  Today, I was craving bubble tea. Usually, I get my bubble tea from Teazzi on 14th street once a week but havenâ€™t been since the quarentine. So today I decided to make my own homemade bobba from scratch amd honey oolong milk tea
</p>

<p class ="t3">
The recipe I followed: <br> HOMEMADE BOBA INGREDIENTS <br>0.5 oz Cocoa <br> 1/2 cup Water <br> 5 oz Tapioca Flour <br> 2.5 oz Brown Sugar <br>BROWN SUGAR SYRUP <br> 1 cup Brown Sugar <br> 1 cup Water <br> Homemade Boba 
</p>

<p class ="t4">
  I was actually really happy with how it turned out. I thought it tastes better than store bought because its homemade and fresh!
</p>

<p class ="t5">
  INSTRUCTIONS <br> HOMEMADE BOBA <br> Mixed tapioca and cocoa well, set a side Heat brown sugar and water until brown sugar dissolved and boiled then immediate pour in mixed tapioca flour and mixed them well 
</p>

<p class ="t6">
  Cook tapioca dough a little while until smooth and shiny, then transfer to a chopping board Needing tapioca dough while it hot until get smooth texture, covered with damp muslin waiting for rolling the Boba ball Take some dough out and roll it until it is about a quarter inches dimension and cut it about 0.5 cm Roll it in a ball shape until finished then dusting flour on Boba balls
</p>

<p class ="t7">
  Pre-heat the water until boiled then add homemade Boba Balls in and stir until the Boba balls floating up the top and boil it for 30 mins and turn the heat off Put the lid on and let Homemade Boba balls stand in a saucepan for another 20 mins Then wash Homemade Boba balls 3-4 time to get rid off an excess starch or until water clear, then strain it
</p>

<p class ="t8">
FOR BROWN SUGAR BOBA <br> Heat equal amount of brown sugar and water in a saucepan (about 1/2 cup of each) and add Homemade Boba balls by using low to medium heat Heat it about 7-10 mins when syrup get thicker turn the heat off, let it cool down for 10 mins Put homemade Brown Sugar Boba into 20 oz cup, add ice then pour your drink on top. Add foam if appropriate and stir up before drinking just to mix everything together
